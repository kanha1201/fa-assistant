1. **Welcome Screen**: Tensor logo with greeting message
2. **Quick Actions**: Three buttons (Summarise, Red Flags, Bull/Bear)
3. **Chat Interface**: Input field to ask questions about Eternal's financials

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If the frontend doesn't connect to backend:
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Make sure you're opening the file, not a folder

## 📝 Notes

- The frontend uses file:// protocol (local file)
- Backend must be running for API calls to work
- All features are fully functional!

**Enjoy using Tensor! 🎉**
